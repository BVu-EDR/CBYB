        <p>Ensure that you remain inside your property boundaries during construction to avoid boarder disputes, encroachments, trespassing,
          and lawsuits. Depending on your jurisdictions zoning laws there are different rules for how far a structure must be from
          your own property line for it to be legal. </p>
        <p>An abutter is a property which your property boarders, meaning that you share a common boundary on one or more sides of
          your property. Abutters identified below and on the map. </p>
        <p>A setback is the minimum distance which a building should be set back from the property line or special zone. Setbacks
          vary by zoning district and type of structure. Please identify your zoning district (found below) to fully understand
          your setback requirements and reductions/exceptions.
